            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p> Everything Dog Grooming </p>
            
             <p>Like the name of the business states, this is a dog grooming business, which offers all kinds of services: Bathing, Cutting/trimming/shaving, brushing, nail clipping, ear cleaning, teeth brushing.  </p><!--Short description of the company-->
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Obviously the target audience are dog owners. They have the specific need for professional dog groomers because grooming your dog at home can be quite difficult. You may not have all the tools you need at home, or even the time to groom your dog properly. Because caring for a dog can be quite time consuming. Also professionals have more knowledge on how to. And probably the most important purpose, professional grooming has health benefits for the dogs. So everyone who wants to properly care for their dog and lives in the nearby (imaginary) area of the business would and should visit this site.  </p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
